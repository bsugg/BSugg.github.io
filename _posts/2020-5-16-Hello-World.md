I have updated my site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of my repository (example shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make my first post is to edit this one, but I decided to create a new markdown file in the /_posts/ directory. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
