#### _Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites). What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language? Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)_

I think being a data scientist means having the flexibility to work with several different disciplines such as data engineering, software engineering, and statistics. It also includes weighing the varying expectations of others who have different perceptions of what a data scientist does. I personally see a data scientist as being a blend between data wrangling and applied statistics. Their duties should be split between data gathering, data modeling, and statistical analysis ... along with understanding the questions, requirements, and underlying factors they are presented to investigate.

The primary similarity between data scientists and statisticians would be their knowledge of applied statistics, with a statistician expected to hold more advanced knowledge in modeling and drawing conclusions. A data scientist, on the other hand, should be more familiar with data mining and the sustainable structuring of reusable data sets for future analysis. I view myself leaning more towards a data scientist... having an interest in understanding where data comes from and how it should be formulated in order to produce significant analysis that can be translated into relevant answers for any audience.
