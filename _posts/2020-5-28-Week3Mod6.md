#### _Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites). What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language? Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)_

The primary software I have worked with prior to this course was SAS. I recently received my advanced certification in SAS, and have enjoyed learning R for the first time in 558, and drawing comparisons between the two. I think the biggest functionality of R that I find appealing is the flexibility of the language via the various open source packages that are available for download. There literally seems to be a package available for almost anything you can think of doing in R, which can also seem overwhelming at first to new users trying to figure out where to start.

What I miss most about SAS, ironically, is the more rigid structure of the language ... for example, in SAS you cannot download several open source packages and all of a sudden find yourself with multiple functions at hand that accomplish the same task, each with their own varying degree of syntax. SAS has been refined, tried, and tested over several decades, and in my opinion is better suited for enterprise level solutions.

R, on the other hand, seems to be great for individual analysis and short term projects. That said, I have only been using R the past 2 weeks and am looking forward to learning more of its capabilities!! So far I have found the language itself intuitive and easy to learn, and the syntax in most cases is not complicated. I am definitely a fan of the look and feel of R Studio! Having that one-stop-shop view of input, output, command line, stored variables, etc has proven beneficial in getting comfortable with what is happening each time code is executed.
