#### _Go back and read your initial blog post where we discussed data science as well as your blog post about your thoughts on R.  Write a reflection post about:_
- What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?  
- What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?  
- What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  

In brief summary...
