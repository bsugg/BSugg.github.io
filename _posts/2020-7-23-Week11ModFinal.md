title: Week 11 - Final Post

#### _Go back and read your initial blog post where we discussed data science as well as your blog post about your thoughts on R.  Write a reflection post about:_
- What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?  
- What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?  
- What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  

After reflecting on the past two months of this course, my original thoughts around what a data scientist is and what they do still remains the same. The role is a blend of many functions ... data engineering, software engineering, and statistics. From cleaning, transforming, modeling, and presenting data, the assignments and projects of this course have helped illustrate this belief that a data scientist wears the hats of many different roles.  

Using R for data science is a no brainer. It is great for individual analysis and proof of concept work, but I still question its application at an enterprise level, especially for large scale projects at larger organizations. For smaller projects and personal experiments, it is perfect. I will personally continue using it beyond this course and will try to learn more of its capabilities ... I still feel like I have only scratched the surface of what is possible from the available packages and their respective capabilities.  

THANK YOU for introducing me not only to R, but also to the general framework to follow for approaching data science projects (building a data foundation, exploratory analysis with summaries, modeling, and conclusions). Being able to present conclusions and the process followed from start to finish to reach those conclusions is instrumental to gaining the respect and trust of those who rely on your analysis. I look forward to using this language and problem solving structure both personally and professionally for the foreseeable future. I have already installed RStudio on my corporate laptop and started working with company data!
